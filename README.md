# CISC101-Group5-PaperSummarizer

## Overview

**PaperSummarizer** is a tool developed by our CISC101 group project. It takes academic or research papers (e.g. PDF or plain-text) as input and generates a concise summary — extracting the key points, main arguments, and contributions, to help users quickly digest long papers.  

This tool is especially useful for students, researchers, or anyone who needs a quick read-through of academic literature without reading the entire paper in detail.

##  What It Does / Features

- Accepts a paper (PDF or text) as input.  
- Processes the content (parsing, text extraction, cleaning).

  - main thesis / research question,  
  - methodology / approach,  
  - key findings / results,  
  - conclusions and implications.  
- (Optional) Allows customization: verbosity, summary length, output format.  
- Helps speed up literature reviews, course reading, or research prep.
